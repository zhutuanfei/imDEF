imDEF is a dynamic ensemble framework for imbalanced data classification. 
imDEF can handle two-class and multiclass imbalanced data.
Call demo_imDEF.m, demo_imDEF_E, demo_imDEF_CV, and demo_imDEF_MO to run imDEF, imDEF_E, imDEF_CV, and imDEF_MO, respectively.
The details of these methods can be found in the paper and the corresponding supplementary material. 
If there are any bugs in your running process, please contact me via zhutuanfei@hnu.edu.cn. I will get back to you as soon as possible.
